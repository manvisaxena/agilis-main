# Getting Started with App

In this challenge, I have created a carousel (Image slider). with login-logout functionality.
When LOGGED IN -> You will see landscape images in the slider.
When LOGGED OUT -> You will see animal images in the slider.

It is a simple example of slider including
- an auto slideshow of images
- login logout functionality(note-: I havent used sessions or authentication tokens, can be logged in using any string)

## Steps to run the app-:
1. Clone the repo and open in any IDE(visual studio?).
2. In the VSTerminal(or terminal), `cd agilis-app/` if you are not in the folder.
3. `npm install` to install all dependencies, this should create an node_modules folder.
4. Use script `npm start` to Runs the app in the development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
